## Code concepts
 **control flow**
 ```sh
 if (condition) 
     => {do something, then break} :
     => {do something, then break} : 
     => {do something, then break} : 
     ... ;

```
 **For loop**
 ```sh
   for (1 : 100) - 'for loop'
    # same as 
   for (1 : 100 by 1) - 'by' here means steps
    # i=i+2
   for (1 : 100 by 2) 

 ```
 
 **Variables declaration**
 ```sh
var -  dynamic variable
var#  - dynamic array
var#2 - fixed size array
VAR  - constant
 ```
